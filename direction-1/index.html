					<blockquote>“The thing that pisses me off the most is the degradation of the intellectual role of the designer.” </blockquote>
					<p>This is what my friend tells me, as we listen to each other’s anguished outpourings replete with VAT numbers, freelancing and short-term contracts. And that made me wonder what constitutes that role, whether it actually existed, how it vanished and what replaced it. Trying to answer these questions, I’d like to focus on graphic design as it is the field where I come from, and I believe it represents a paradigmatic case within the so-called creative industries.</p>
					<p>These days we hear a lot about the <span>gig economy</span>, the economy of little jobs, of chores. Platforms like Uber, AirBnB or Foodora are quickly becoming the direct intermediaries of any kind of service, a seemingly unavoidable development since they are prone to monopolization. Graphic design is no exception: online marketplaces like Fiverr and TaskRabbit offer access to graphic designers able to create a logo, a website, a poster.</p>
					<p>On <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a>, whose motto is “do not just dream, do”, a logo apparently costs between five and nine dollars, the same goes for an infographic or an illustration. On <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/">TaskRabbit</a> (“we do chores, you live life”) the hourly rates seem to fluctuate between 20 and 60 dollars per hour. The description of a <span>tasker</span> strikes me: Barbara J., $25 per hour, claims to be a self-taught graphic designer, since all her previous jobs included tasks where she created graphics. This <span>generalization</span> of graphic design is the keystone of my argument on its potential intellectual role.</p>

					<h2>Automation, Defaultism and Template Culture</h2>
					<p>Reading the recent headlines, it might appear that we have been teleported back to the ’30s, a time when John Maynard Keynes, a highly respected economist, could say without the slightest hesitation that soon weekly working hours would fall down to fifteen. This forecast is a vivid expression of the zeitgeist, imbued with a firm confidence in the advent of the “leisure society.” The reduction of working hours would have been made possible by machines, able to automate an increasing number of processes.</p>
					<p>Nowadays, the hype around automation is back to its record high thanks to the advances in artificial intelligence and to an ultra-cited 2013 study according to which 47% of the jobs currently performed in the US are put at risk by computerization. The study includes a ranking of about 700 professions ordered by probability of automation in ascending order. Graphic design occupies the 161st place. Not bad.</p>
					<p>However, I think that graphic design (in which I include web design as well), has already undergone the drastic effects of automation, at least in a broad sense. The Web is full of generators capable of producing endless permutations of logos. Some of these generators make use of <a href="https://looka.com/logo-maker/">neural networks</a> and therefore have the ability improve their designs by “learning” from their mistakes. But there is no need to be a Singularity zealot to acknowledge the revolutionary impact of digital technology on graphic design. In the early ’90s several desktop publishing applications found a widespread use among professionals and ordinary people alike. A few years later “photoshop” became a verb, and, together with other elements of the Adobe suite, it populated the collective imagination. The statements of the designers who were first inspired by computers are full of enthusiasm: “We are the primitives of a new technological era”, the Emigre duo proclaimed, omitting that so was everyone else. At the same time, the work of these pioneers, full of proudly executed mishaps, seems to conceal a passive-aggressive form of Luddism.</p>
					<p>In his dystopian novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_Piano_(novel)">Player Piano (1952)</a>, <a href="https://www.vonnegut.com/">Kurt Vonnegut</a> depicts an almost completely automated society where it is sufficient to simply record the movements of a worker on a disk to ensure that the machine will endlessly repeat them with full accuracy. When I open Word or InDesign, I run into a similar situation, since the page, only apparently blank, already contains a series of design choices registered in advance, such as the margins’ width.</p>
					<p>That’s how template culture comes to life, where every new project actually derives from a long sequence of previous projects. In the mid-2000s, default settings became fashionable. Why waste time on design decisions when one can celebrate the aprioristic purity of the template? Aren’t we like dwarfs sitting on the shoulders of giants? Perhaps, this is the most authentic expression of the idealistic impulse that permeates the modernist ideology. British designer <a href="https://eatock.com/">Daniel Eatock</a> quipped on this trend by producing a generic poster that could be used for any type of event. In this way, as it is the case in Player Piano, Eatock had done nothing but make himself obsolete.</p>
